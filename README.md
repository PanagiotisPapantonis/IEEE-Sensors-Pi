# Spring Project 2022 - SensorsPy
Programming Team - Spring Project 2022 - SensorsPy
IEEE Student Branch University of Western Macedonia, Kastoria


The current project was assigned to the programming team of the IEEE student branch of UOWM (Univerity of Western Macedonia) in the time period of Aplil 1st 2022 and expeted to be delived until June 2022.
This project is based on receiving information by a temperature/humidity sensor connected to a raspberry and displacing them with the help of a python made GUI.
The current project is able to tract the temperature and humidity changes of the last 48 hours, presenting the changes with the help of 2 diagramms. 

Libraries used for the GUI:                                    
  1)Tkinter                                               
  2)Pil                                                   
Libraries used in receiving the data from the sensor:     
  3)Adafruit_DHT                                          
  4)time                                                  
  5)pandas                                                
Libraries used for creating diagramms:                    
  6)array                                                 
  7)matplotlib.pyplot       
  8)numpy
